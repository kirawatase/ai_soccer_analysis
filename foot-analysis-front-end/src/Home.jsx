    quote: 'As a four-time state-winning champion coach, Iâ€™ve always believed that success comes from not just hard work but also smart work. Incorporating AI-powered data visualization into our soccer analysis has transformed how we approach the game. The ability to track player positioning, distance, and in-game decisions in real time has given us insights beyond what the naked eye can see. It allows us to break down plays, adjust formations, and optimize strategies with precision. I find this very applicable to our game.'

            All my life I knew one thing. Soccer. Day in, day out, I lived and breathed strategies and techniques and pushed myself to the absolute limit.
            I played against people older than me. I played against boys. I played D1 at OSU. All the odds were stacked against me but I stood my
            ground and even excelled. Life however, had other plans. I was injured and forced into medical retirement. I was lost without direction. However, 
            I will not let the strategies and techniques I've perfected over countless years go to waste. I have found new passion in mathematics, AI, and coding.
            It is time to pass on my torch and this is my way of doing it.
